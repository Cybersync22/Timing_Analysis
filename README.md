# Timing_Analysis

## Timing Analysis using GNN for RTL Complexity Prediction

#### SOLUTION SUMMARY
A Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based Timing Prediction Tool that extracts RTL netlist features and predicts the logic depth of a circuit.

#### FEATURES 
Parses Verilog Netlists and converts them into circuit graphs.
Extracts node-level features (Fan-In, Fan-Out, Depth).
Implements a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to predict logic depth.
Provides real-time timing prediction on new circuits.
